## Human 3D parametrization
From 2015 there are two main standards in the computer vision community for the parametrization of the human body.

### [SMPL](https://smpl.is.tue.mpg.de/)
 Skinned Multi-Person Linear Model (2015) is a realistic 3D model of the human body that is based on skinning and blend shapes and is learned from thousands of 3D body scans.
 This site provides resources to learn about SMPL, including example FBX files with animated SMPL models, and code for using SMPL in Python, Maya and Unity."

### Question 1: Is SMPL enough for our medical application?
